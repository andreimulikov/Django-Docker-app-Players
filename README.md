# Django-Docker-app-Players

Django app - Manchester United Players with home page, team player list page and player details page. The application allows us to list and register Manchester United players in the database, update player information, remove players and add new ones.

The example of this application also shows the interaction between Django and Docker, building the image and running the container with the application.
